 <h3 >This is the edit screen. You will have to set a title for your build, next choose the map the build should be shown on. The group title will be the title for this item group, for example "starting items". By pressing the "Add a new group button" you can do different groups, for example "Items against AD" "Items against AP" etc. You can now drag items from the search list to the left into the square in the middle. The button to the left of the search bar will open a filter list. When you're finished just press the save button. Your build will be downloaded as a .zip file. </h3 >
