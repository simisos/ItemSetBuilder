# ItemSetBuilder

<br><br>
This is our Item Set Builder Project created for the second Riot API challenge.
We created this tool because we think there's a demand for it. <br> With this tool you can create importable builds online.
After you import your builds into your league directory, they show up ingame as shop recommendations.

You can find our demo at http://sparence.ch/
